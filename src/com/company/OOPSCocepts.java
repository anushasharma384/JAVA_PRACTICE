/*
    There are four pillars of OOPS:
        1. Abstraction: Show only necessary information to the user and hide the underlying method description which is unnecessary to him.
        This can be done using abstract classes in which it's method tells us that what function is going to be performed and doesn't specify how it's going to be defined.
        2. Encapsulation: Process of wrapping the code and data together into a single unit. We make the variables private in a class
        so that they can't be accessed by some other class but make getters and setters to use and set their value.
        3. Inheritance: Process of one class inheriting methods and properties of another class. We have a parent class and a child class.
        class child extends parent
        4. Polymorphism: Poly means many and morph means forms. One method having different definitions. Two types of polymorphism is there:
          a. Static Polymorphism.
          b. Dynamic Polymorphism.
